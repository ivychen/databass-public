## A5: Lineage (Optional)

* Released:  11/5
* Due: 11/20 11:59PM EST
* Teams of 1 or 2


The goal of this assignment is to play with two lineage-capture systems
and comment on their differences.

### System 1: GPROM

Setup

* Follow the instructions to install [GPROM + SQLite](https://github.com/IITDBGroup/gprom)
* Download the small [TPC-h](./files/TPC-H-small.db ) SQLite database (thanks to [lovasoa/TPCH-sqlite](https://github.com/lovasoa/TPCH-sqlite))
* Use GPROM to run the following TPC-H query, and report the provenance for the first output record.

```
SELECT l.l_orderkey, 
       sum(l.l_extendedprice * (1-l.l_discount)) as revenue, 
       o.o_orderdate, 
       o.o_shippriority 
FROM (select * from customer limit 200) as c, 
     (select * from orders limit 200) as o, 
     (select * from lineitem limit 200) as l 
WHERE c.c_custkey = o.o_custkey AND 
      l.l_orderkey = o.o_orderkey 
GROUP BY l.l_orderkey, o.o_orderdate, o.o_shippriority
``` 

### System 2: Databass

Databass also supports lineage capture, as described [in the Smoke paper](./files/papers/smoke-vldb18.pdf).  Of course, it is not nearly as performant, since Databass generates Python code instead of C++.  Regardless, in this step, you will implement lineage capture for the root operators (Yield, Collect), and then generate some lineage.

To do so, edit the file under `databass/compile/py/root.py` and follow the instructions in the comments.

Evaluate your code using the following unit tests.  We recommend you craft your own queries and ground truth to verify that your code is correct.

``` 
pytest test/a5.py -x
```
